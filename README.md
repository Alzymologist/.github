Alzymologist Oy is a research and development team capitalizing on overqualified personnel.

We have a chemical laboratory, hardware workshop, software development team, and some urge to do good things. [The company website](https://zymologia.fi) is devoted to our chemical branch and beer analysis work.

Here on Github we organize software and hardware development projects, at the moment mostly focused around [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) ecosystem (Polkadot, Kusama, etc.), the most promising blockchain environment in our humble opinion. We are not representatives of Parity Inc, although we work closely with them.

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® We are an official Finnish enterprise, VAT number FI31620309. As a small business, we are experimenting with fully legal cryptocurrency accounting. We pay taxes following evolving regulations.
